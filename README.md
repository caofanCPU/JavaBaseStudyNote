## Remarks
* For **Collection Framework** learning, I recommend to you [`MapSetOK.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/集合学习/MapSet综合/MapSetOK.java) which tries to show the different details between Set and Map. Through the code, you can know the usages of **Comparator**.  

* For **IO Interface** learning, [`CopyTextByBuffer.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO学习/CopyTextByBuffer.java) and [`FileContentCompare.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO学习/IO操作与TreeMap/FileContentCompare.java) in project ["IO操作与TreeMap"](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO操作与TreeMap/FileContentCompare.java) will be a good choice. You can see how to copy a file which was in your disk into another place, what's more, it's helpful that knowing the usages of Character stream and the Byte stream.

* For **Network Programming** learning, it's a application of IO Stream actually. It is worth mentioning that *Java Web* has provided a lot of tools and frameworks which have already taken the place of Network Programming. *And because of this, pay your attention into IO Stream in the code*. At last, be familiar with TCP/UDP protocols will take you into the real net world.  

* For *Java Web developments*, building a bookstore by using **servlet+dbutils+xml propties** will be a interesting start. You can see what a website looks like, what's more, and how to create it through coding by Java.
