## Components
- Collection Framework

- IO Interface

- Network Programming

***
## Remarks
* For **Collection Framework** learning, I recommended to you [`MapSetOK.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master//集合学习/MapSet综合/MapSetOK.java). The program try to show the differences and details between Set and Map. Through the code, you can know the usages of Comparator.
* For **IO Interface** learning, [`CopyTextByBuffer.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO学习/CopyTextByBuffer.java) and [`FileContentCompare.java`](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO学习/IO操作与TreeMap/FileContentCompare.java) in project ["IO操作与TreeMap"](https://github.com/caofanCPU/JavaBaseStudyNote/tree/master/IO操作与TreeMap/FileContentCompare.java) will be a good choice. You can study how to copy a file which in your disk to another place, what's more, knowing the usages of Character stream and the Byte stream that can help you a lot.
* For **Network Programming**, it's application of IO Stream. However, "Java Web" provides a lot of tools and frameworks which instead of Network Programming. *So, pay your attention into IO Stream in the code*. At last, be familiar with TCP/UDP protocols will take you into the real net world.
